Date: 2023-04-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Persistent message transmission, as well as queuing is needed for high load.

## Decision

Not used in our prototype.

## Consequences

Adds a small overhead in latency compared to other approaches like RPC. Great advantage lies in its persistent message transport.
