# 30. Use full verification to validate the update

Date: 2023-04-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To provide maximum security it makes sense to check every metadata type with its signature on its validity in Uptane.

## Decision

Not used in our prototype.

## Consequences

The update process becomes more secure, but the memory consumption as well as the computational requirements increase. Not every ECU type supports that.
