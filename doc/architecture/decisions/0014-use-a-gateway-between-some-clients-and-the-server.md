# 14. Use a gateway between some clients and the server

Date: 2023-04-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To provide better load control options or compatibility with VPNs it can make sense to use a gateway between server and devices / cars. 

## Decision

Not used in our prototype.

## Consequences

This is probably more suitable in a general IoT context, when managing a device fleet in a company, where every device is connected to the private company network. Cars are mostly connected to cellular networks. But for load balancing it can still make sense.
