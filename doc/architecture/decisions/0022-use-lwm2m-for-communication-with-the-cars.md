# 22. Use LWM2M for communication with the cars

Date: 2023-04-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

It can be helpful to have a protocol that already provides OTA update and IoT management functionality.

## Decision

Not used int our prototype.

## Consequences

Reduces implementational effort for IoT management or OTA updates. But often needs further implementation, since it is not as compatible with already available software as other protocols.
