# 9. Provide manual updates

Date: 2023-04-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Providing manual updates can help when only one car in a fleet needs a fix.

## Decision

Not implemented in our prototype.

## Consequences

Important feature that enables corrections for certain cars. May involve some risks if it is not semantically checked, if the software that gets installed is really suiting the purpose of the car or the fleet.
